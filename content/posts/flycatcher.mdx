**I have decided to shut down the main Flycatcher service because I don't have enough time to grow it, but I still have demo videos and the landing page up.**

Flycatcher is a full-stack web app powered by NextJS that uses MongoDB to store user data, Supabase to handle authentication, and Stripe to manage payments.

I have also built out image uploads so users can upload their own logos and favicons, and I use Mailgun to let them send emails to their subscribers.

I designed and developed the entire website myself and it is fully functional on mobile devices.

This is what a waitlist looks like:

This one is of course Flycatcher branded but users are able to edit colors, text, metadata, images, and add social links to make a board completely personalized for their brand.
