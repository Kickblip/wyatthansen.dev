# Background

I built the vast majority of this project in a bored afternoon at school.
I was originally inspired by a video of an ascii donut spinning around.
I loved the retro and minimalistic look of the final product and wanted to make my own.

After looking at some shapes I settled on a dodecahedron because I thought it looked cool.
I chose to build the site with ThreeJS, a JavaScript 3D graphics engine.
Letting ThreeJS handle the perspective and rendering meant that I could focus on creating polyhedra.

# Calculating Polyhedra

To build the geometries I used the data from a [collection of polyhedra models](http://www.georgehart.com/virtual-polyhedra/vp.html) made by George Hart.

```javascript
Tetrahedron: {
    name: "Tetrahedron",
    category: ["Platonic Solid"],
    vertex: [
        [0, 0, 1.732051],
        [1.632993, 0, -0.5773503],
        [-0.8164966, 1.414214, -0.5773503],
        [-0.8164966, -1.414214, -0.5773503],
    ],
    edge: [
        [0, 1],
        [0, 2],
        [0, 3],
        [1, 2],
        [1, 3],
        [2, 3],
    ],
    face: [
        [0, 1, 2],
        [0, 2, 3],
        [0, 3, 1],
        [1, 3, 2],
    ],
}
```

The vertices are stored as an array of arrays, where each sub-array is the coordinates of a vertex.
The edges are stored as an array of arrays, where each sub-array is the indices of the vertices that make up the edge.
The faces are stored as an array of arrays, where each sub-array is the indices of the vertices that make up the face.
For this project, I'm only using the vertices and faces because that's all ThreeJS needs to construct the polyhedra.

# Ascii Filter

Since I was using ThreeJS, I had to add the ascii effect as a filter over a normal 3D geometry.
The filter adds an element to the DOM that holds text.
The ascii characters inside this big element are chosen based on the luminosity (brightness) of the pixels underneath.

<div className="flex">
  <div className="w-1/2">![before](/images/polyhedra/before.png)</div>
  <div className="w-1/2">![after](/images/polyhedra/after.png)</div>
</div>

# Keeping it Simple

What initially interested me about a spinning ascii cube was the minimalism of the presentation.
For my UI I wanted to preserve this simplicity.
The UI centers around a small slider at the top of the screen.
This way of discovering shapes is more interactive than a dropdown menu.
A dropdown menu would also be unnecessary because most people don't know the platonic solids by name.
