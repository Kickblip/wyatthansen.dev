# Next.js + Contentlayer + TypeScript

Bootstrapped with Vercel's Next.js 13, Contentlayer [template](https://next-contentlayer.vercel.app). Modified by Kickblip.

## Techstack Used:

- Framework: [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- Language: [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Styling: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Icons (mostly): [Heroicons](https://heroicons.com/)
- Content: [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- Content Management: [Contentlayer](https://www.contentlayer.dev/)
- Deployment: [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Directory Structure

`app/*`: I'm using the new next.js app directory structure. This directory contains the main app.

`components/*`: All custom components are stored in this directory.

`content/*`: This directory contains all the Contentlayer contents.

`public/*`: This directory contains all the static assets of the website.

`public/covers/*`: This is where the thumbnails for posts are kept. They are matched to the post title.

`public/images/*`: The somewhat confusingly named `images` directory is for images within the posts.

**Bonus Tip:** use `/app/page.tsx` to edit the homepage and use `/app/posts/[...slug]/page.tsx` to edit a post page.
